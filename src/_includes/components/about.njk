                        <p>My love for all things tech started at a young age when my parents gifted my brothers and I a Commodore 64 computer. From that moment on, I was fascinated by how computers worked and the possibilities they offered</p>
                        <p>As I grew older, my curiosity led me to explore the world of web development, especially after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Web-Design-Beginners-JavaScript-dp-1491960205/dp/1491960205/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">Jennifer Robbin's</a> inspiring web design book. It was a natural fit for me, as it combines my love for technology with my passion for creativity. Eager to get my hands dirty, I signed up for a web development course. Since then, I've honed my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to become a capable front-end developer. Today, I'm proud to say I create websites that look great and provide a seamless user experience for visitors.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not busy crafting beautiful websites, you'll find me curled up with a good book, exploring thought-provoking podcasts or getting lost in the intricate plots of the latest British crime drama.</p>
